# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stevie
I'm a second year games computing student studying at the University of Lincoln.  
I'm non-binary, but I'm not particularly fussed about pronouns. Surprise me! Or don't, again, I don't really mind.

I began my journey into game development in late 2017 using Lua.  
Since I began studying at university, I've seized any opportunity that I can to further my understanding of games.  
I'm particularly fond of Rust, although I have yet to use it in any significant capacity.

I have experience using:
- Rust
- C#
- C++
- Lua

## ðŸ”­ Current Project
This year, I'm focusing largely on university coursework.  
At the moment, I act as project manager for both my team modules:
- **Concept Development**  
  Short prototype for a top-down 2D stealth game inspired by Monaco
- **Team Software Engineering**  
  Stealth game with a focus on non-verbal accessibility features
