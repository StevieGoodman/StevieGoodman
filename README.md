# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stevie
I'm a second year games computing student studying at the University of Lincoln.  
I'm non-binary, but I'm not particularly fussed about pronouns. Surprise me! Or don't, again, I don't really mind.

I began my journey into game development in late 2017 using Lua.  
Since I began studying at university, I've seized any opportunity that I can to further my understanding of games.  
I'm particularly fond of Rust, although I have yet to use it in any significant capacity.

I have experience using:
- Rust
- C#
- C++
- Lua

## ðŸ”­ Current Project
This year, I'm focusing largely on university coursework.  
At the moment, I act as project manager for both my team modules:
- [x] **[Co-conspirators: partners in crime](https://github.com/CGP2014/Monaclone)** (Concept Development)  
  Short prototype for a top-down 2D stealth game inspired by Monaco
- [ ] **Team Software Engineering**  
  Stealth game featuring a visually impaired protagonist
  
However, I look for opportunities to work on my own projects where possible:
- [ ] **Stealth game prototype**  
  Simple unnamed prototype created in a week to practise application of SOLID principles
- [ ] **UoL Global Game Jam 2022**  
  48h game jam entry for University of Lincoln's annual Global Game Jam event
