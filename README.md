# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stevie
I'm a third year games computing student studying at the University of Lincoln.  
I'm non-binary, but I'm not particularly fussed about pronouns. Surprise me! Or don't, again, I don't really mind.

I began my journey into game development in late 2017 using Lua.  
Since I began studying at university, I've seized any opportunity that I can to further my understanding of games.  
I'm particularly fond of the Playdate.

I have experience using:

- Lua (7y)
- C# (3y)
- C++ (1y)
- Rust (1y)
- C (learning)
