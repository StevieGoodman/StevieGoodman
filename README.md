# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stevie
I'm a second year games computing student studying at the University of Lincoln.  
I'm non-binary, but I'm not particularly fussed about pronouns. Surprise me! Or don't, again, I don't really mind.

I began my journey into game development in late 2017 using Lua.  
Since I began studying at university, I've seized any opportunity that I can to further my understanding of games.  
I'm particularly fond of Rust, although I have yet to use it in any significant capacity.

I have experience using:
- Rust
- C#
- C++
- Lua

## ðŸ”­ Current Project
This year, I'm focusing largely on university coursework.  
At the moment, I act as project manager for both my team modules:
- **Concept Development**  
  Short prototype for a top-down 2D stealth game inspired by Monaco
- **Team Software Engineering**  
  3D stealth game with the theme of "non-verbal communication between players and NPCs"

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
On weekends I spend time creating prototypes in Unity - each focusing on an aspect of the Unity engine I'd like to learn about.
I haven't created any yet, but I'll list them here when I have!
